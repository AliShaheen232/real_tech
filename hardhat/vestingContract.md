The owner will

- deploy the contract.
- will mention 4 dates of unlocking the amount as a percentage %
- Will mention the % amount for each date
- Will mention receiver address (beneficiary)

Deposit of tokens can come from anyone. The contract will hold the tokens until the unlock dates.

The receiver will

- At each unlock date the receiver has to withdraw tokens from the smart contract.
- They must know how to withdraw using etherscan or other ethereum explorers.
- They must pay the ethereum network fee.
- Can the contract airdrop the unlocked amount??

The "owner" from deployment will trigger the airdrop after each unlock date. and then the "reciever" will recieve the airdrop.
So I will trigger the airdrop after each unlock date.. then the person receiving the tokens will recieve the airdrop..
